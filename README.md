# StreamSentry: Real-Time Anomaly Detection in Data Streams

## Description

StreamSentry is a Python-based tool designed to detect anomalies in continuous data streams. 
It uses [...  ALGORITHM NAME] to identify unusual patterns, such as exceptionally high values or deviations from the norm, 
in real-time sequences of floating-point numbers.

## Objective

1. Algorithm Selection: Identify and implement a suitable algorithm for anomaly detection, capable of adapting to concept drift and seasonal variations.
2. Data Stream Simulation: Design a function to emulate a data stream, incorporating regular patterns, seasonal elements, and random noise.
3. Anomaly Detection: Develop a real-time mechanism to accurately flag anomalies as the data is streamed.
4. Optimization: Ensure the algorithm is optimized for both speed and efficiency.
5. Visualization: Create a straightforward real-time visualization tool to display both the data stream and any detected anomalies.
