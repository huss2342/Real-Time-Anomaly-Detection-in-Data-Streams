# StreamSentry: Real-Time Anomaly Detection in Data Streams

## Description

StreamSentry is a Python-based tool designed to detect anomalies in continuous data streams. 
It uses [...  ALGORITHM NAME] to identify unusual patterns, such as exceptionally high values or deviations from the norm, 
in real-time sequences of floating-point numbers.

## Features

- Real-time anomaly detection in continuous data streams
- Data stream simulation with regular patterns, seasonal elements, and random noise
- Visualization of data stream and detected anomalies
- Optimized for both speed and efficiency
- Adaptable to concept drift and seasonal variations
